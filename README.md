# leaflet-challenge

This challenge employs Leaflet, JavaScript, and D3 to create visualizations of earthquake data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS holds the mandate to furnish scientific data concerning natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental conditions, and the effects of climate and land-use alterations. Its scientists continuously innovate methods and tools to deliver timely, pertinent, and valuable insights into Earth's dynamics and phenomena.


Access the Data: The USGS gives earthquake data in various formats, updating every 5 minutes. "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" dataset was chosen from their GeoJSON Feed page. This data comes in JSON format, which is used for visualization.

Visualize the Data: With Leaflet, a map was to show all the earthquakes from the dataset based on where it occured. The size of the markers shows the earthquake's magnitude, and the color indicates its depth. Bigger markers represent stronger earthquakes, while darker colors means deeper ones. Clicking on a marker shows extra info about the earthquake. A legend was created to explain the map's data.
